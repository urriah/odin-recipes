    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hamburger consists of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. The patties are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing, and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Egg</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Black pepper</li>
      <li>Ground beef</li>
      <li>Bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
      <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
      <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
      <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
      <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). </li>
